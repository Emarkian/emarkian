               <h2 class="title"> OUR ENVIRONMENT</h2> <br>
        <p class="essay"> 
                An environment is the natural world that surrounds us. It is very important to keep it
                clean in order to live a healthy and peaceful life. However, the environmental pollution
                has become one of the biggest threats to the Earth. It can affect our future one day.
                People suffer from their own mistakes. Pollution endangers our existence and
                destroys our living environment. The future will either be green or not at all.Â 
                <br><br>
                People are considered to be the most intelligent creatures on Earth who are able
                to learn new things in the universe which can lead them to the technological
                advancement. It goes without saying that there are many benefits in technological
                development for the economy but it also destroys our environment gradually. We
                develop technologies and science to make our life better but we fall to think that it can
                ruin everything that surround us in the near future. The destructive human activity
                causes several adverse effects to the environment. The effects of pollution are
                devastative. It is very important to explore the various types of pollutions and all
                possible ways of their prevention in order to make our planet a safer place for the
                growth and development of all living things.
                <br><br>
                Water pollution is one of the pivotal problems nowadays. A lot of garbage is
                thrown directly into the water. Moreover, a lot of factories, mills, and plants discharge
                the untreated industrial wastes and other unsafe substances into the water bodies.
                Water is also polluted by fertilizations and pesticides which are widely used in
                agriculture. The contamination of the living environment leads to the deaths of the
                entire natural ecosystems. There are many approaches to garbage utilization but most
                of the poor countries just don`t have enough money to introduce such up-to-date
                technologies. Air pollution is another humanity`s challenge. The air we breathe has
                contaminated because of uncontrolled release of harmful vehicular and industrial
                smokes. Burning fuels, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
                chemical vapors are the major pollutants of the air. Sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide
                cause a situation called Global Warming when the radiation is absorbed while the
                heat is prevented from escaping.
                <br><br>
                Environment plays a significant role in making our existence on the planet
                possible. Everything we use to live a full life comes under the environment. We just
                can`t live without air, water, land, sunlight, animals, and other natural things.
                Environmental pollution is affecting our lives physically, emotionally, socially,
                economically, and intellectually. It has become a major worldwide issue which cannot
                be solved by the effort of one. We should do our best in order not to put the end to the
                existence of all living things on earth. Every person on our planet should take a little
                step to save our environment and maintain its originality.
                <br><br>
                We should reduce water wastage, save energy, use rechargeable batteries, reuse
                our old things in new ways, and throw wastes properly to its place only. People use
                the components of the environment to fulfill their basic needs of living. We should
                stop polluting and challenging our national resources to ensure sustainable living
                conditions for our future generations. The usage of non-conventional sources of
                energy should be encouraged. Restriction on the use of fossil fuels and pollution
                control laws should be imposed strictly. We have to control the emission of
                greenhouse gases strictly to save our environment from the threat of Global warming.
                <br><br>
                The remarkable growth of technological progress has negative impact on the
                ecological state of our planet. The work of factories and plants and the extraction of
                natural resources result in serious environmental problems that call for radical
                actions for environmental rehabilitation and protection. The influence of the
                devastative human activity shouldn`t be ignored. We should contribute every day to
                the preservation of our natural environment. Mankind should be sure that
                technological advances would never disturb the ecological balance of the Earth.
                Environmental problems should be handled by the united efforts of the global
                community. Nowadays, a lot of international summits, conferences, and presentations
                are held to deal with recycling, waste treatment, and water and soil contamination. We
                should always remember that environmental pollution is an incurable disease. It can
                only be prevented. So, let`s take care of the world that surrounds us!</p>
