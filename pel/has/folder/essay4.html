               <h2 class="title"> It Was Just The Beginning of A Journey</h2> <br>
        <p class="essay"> 
                Exploration is the best revision. Who knew that I am now a free flying eagle, eagerly
                waiting to hunt down my goals. My claws are sharp and my wings are strong enough to
                travel far since travelling and exploring the world are in my top must-do list. Recently, I
                flew to a country known as Jamaica with my best friend, Josephine. It was week hunting
                on summer. You won’t believe when I said Jamaica is really warm but still you can’t
                deny the fact that their beaches and nature are enchanting especially their city.
                <br><br>
                ‘Final call for passenger Flight 376 just five minutes before the gate is closed.’ We
                rushed to Gate C and thank god, the officer on duty was so nice to us so he gave us a
                welcome aboard smile. The fans of the metal bird can be heard miles away. We quietly
                abroad the cabin but you know what? Turns out they were just warming up the engines to
                get ready while the passengers were taking their time to get their seats. The horrendous
                environment was really sickening and we were exhausted after having hard time getting a
                taxi to get to the airport. Right away the stewardess helped us out with our luggage so we
                looked for our seat number. It was a triplet seats so Josephine and I was arguing about
                who were to sit nearby the window. I reluctantly let her take the seat for I have lost in our
                little game. So, I grabbed the seat in the middle and immediately plugged in my red
                shinning earplugs to avoid the boarding sound. Truth to be told, Jamaica was something
                else, something more amazing than what I thought it would really be. We definitely had
                our pleasure time exploring their significant culture and scrumptious signature dishes
                with our taste buds. Jamaica was familiar to me as I kept hearing my friends talking and
                looking up to a Jamaican singer, Bob Marley.
                <br><br>
                When I was about to let down my eyelids, Josephine tapped my resting arm indicating
                there was an announcement informing the passengers that the flight will be taking off in
                few minutes and we need to buckle up. A tall, elegant stewardess, could be the chief, was
                demonstrating some safety precautions to the passengers in case any disaster happens or
                what should be done during an emergency. For me, it was super lame because I’ve been
                listening to the same announcement over and over each time I take a flight for the past
                few years. Right then, it was dark outside and my Supreme watch was showing 8 p.m.
                They took off sharp. All these while,whenever I go overseas, I would be still fascinated
                and blown away by the railway lights. The lights have been a warm goodbye to me. It
                was just a habit for me to take a few shots before rising up the sky. Hope to capture the
                view again in future.
                <br><br>
                The cabin was silent including Josephine as they decided to take a nap after their journey.
                As I was about to shut my phone down and turned on my mini bard-sized IPod, a soft
                voice came and asked for a seat. I ignored because I was thinking he or she was referring
                to the passenger behind me. ‘Ouch!’ Someone pulled off my right earphone so I tried to
                look up with my fist in position wondering who was that daring person I was about to
                slap. My mind was suddenly blank. His eyes were dark brown and glowing even though
                only a small ray of hallway spot light was provided for sleeping mode. His sharp jaw line
                and reddish lips attracted me. The front of his hair pointed up a little. He was in his casual
                t-shirt and black ripped jeans. For a while, I remained silent as our eyes met and it lasted
                for few seconds. ‘Yes, please.’ Out of nowhere, that came from my mouth. He
                apologized for interrupting me while introducing his name as Ryan, I did the same. He
                was in the restroom few minutes ago since he was under the weather. This was his second
                flight in nineteen years. We broke the night silence with our laughs. I don’t know why
                but he was really funny. Those cute dimples on him melted my heart. The way he smiled
                and looked at me in the eyes were really something I have never expected.
                <br><br>
                As Josephine was sleeping, I tried to lower down my voice as I was known back home as
                a loud talker. It was in my blood technically. He shared about his previous journey to
                Jamaica. A run away from his city. I knew it. Demanding a fresh air, he decided to visit
                Jamaica for its natural beauty. Out of the blue, the airplane flew into a thick fog which I
                noticed through the window. The whole cabin was vibrating and shaking. That woke
                Josephine up and she started to look at me and scream. I calmed her down by lending her
                my IPod for a distraction. Coincidently, my hands were shimmering for all of the sudden
                I felt so cold and was scared that anything would happen. I jumped from my seat and
                little as a warm hand landed on mine. We looked at each other and he tried to comfort me
                by trying to explore my life. Nice trick I see. An act was caught in the scene as I saw him
                chuckling and even giggled whenever I did my frightened look. The chaos ended but his
                hand was still on mine and I didn’t know whether he was aware of that or not. A few
                more hours passed and we finally decided to give a goodnight. Smiling while closing my
                eyes, I started thinking if he was the one. He had all the characters I’ve been looking for.
                His hometown coincidently wasn’t too far from mine, just a few miles. I can’t help but to
                take a sneak peak on him sleeping with neck pillow wrapped around his neck. His left
                leg was on top of the other and he bended backwards a little to get more comfortable.
                Without any hesitation, I took a photo of him and straight away saved it in my gallery.
                Here I go again, resting my mind for the next hour.
                <br><br>
                An announcement was made as a sign that we had landed on our beloved soil. Josephine
                woke me up and we were pretty much suffering from jet-lagged now. Ryan woke up
                earlier and he was grabbing his bag pack when suddenly I hit the seat and was almost hit
                the seat arm rest with my head. Once again, he managed to catch me from falling and rub
                my hair wondering I hit it. We looked into each others eyes and this time I was sure to let
                him through my journey. Josephine and I got off the plane and we headed to the lounge to
                buy a taxi ticket. My eyes searched for him while waiting for her and all of a sudden,
                someone called my name from the back. The voice came closer and closer so I turned
                around realizing it was him. Carrying a bag pack while pulling his luggage. I felt pity for
                him but I can’t help myself laughing at the way he ran. He offered us a ride home but we
                said no. ‘When can I see you again?’ He asked with the pity look on him. I don’t know
                how long Josephine was standing behind me and after she heard him saying that, the
                opposite happened. I was supposed to be cheerful but she was the one doing it. How
                typical. She winked at me and gave a little time together. Noticing he was holding his
                phone, I snatched it and saved my number. ‘See you soon in short time’. I smiled and
                went to the taxi. Oh, I almost forgot and thanked god that Josephine reminded me of him.
                I was in the intention to send him his photo that I took earlier but oh my god. I didn’t get
                his contact number. I slapped my forehead and decided to wait for his call.
                <br><br>
                I reached my home after the taxi dropped Josephine off. My eye bags were deep and
                obvious. Clearly I didn’t sleep well in Jamaica or else I will miss my fun time enjoying to
                the fullest. I stepped out from my shower and heard a ‘cling’ sound. A notification
                appeared on my screen at midnight. I jumped onto my bed and checked my inbox. It was
                him and yes I screamed in excitement. We chatted a little while with lots of cute emojis.
                He was concerned of my health and wanted me to switch off the phone and take a rest.
                He was about to say goodbye when I sent him his photo. I was eagerly waiting to see his
                reaction from the beginning. He called me and laughed so hard. It took a while before we
                headed to our bed. I have been through my worst nightmares all these years. I can’t afford
                any risk on this so let’s just go with the flow and watch what happens.
                <br><br>
                His chuckles are still playing in my mind.</p>
