        <p class="essay">
                I entered the classroom and saw him sitting at a desk. The boy had a pale face and messy
                hair, typical of a high school student who just woke up and rushed to school without paying
                much attention to his physical presentation. His school uniform was of austere nature.
                White collared shirt, creased white trousers and worn-out Oxford shoes. His black pin-
                striped necktie hung lazily around his neck with an awkward knot. The boy looked up from
                the scribblings on his notebook and gazed into my soul with his mesmerizing, electric blue
                eyes.
                <br><br>
                I sat at a desk beside the boy and he handed me a piece of paper torn out from his
                notebook. I took it.
                <br><br>
                “Incredible, isn’t it? Nature is magnificently beautiful and the only way to fundamentally
                understand it is by whittling them down to numbers,”the boy said with great joy in his
                voice. I looked at the calculations on the paper-it was Euler’s equation, the most beautiful
                mathematical equation. “But alas, all that will eventually be lost, entropy must take its
                course. Let go and be happier, old man.” I stared at him blankly. The boy smiled.
                <br><br>
                Before I could open my mouth, my surroundings changed to that of a university dorm. A
                couple, possibly in their 20s sat in the middle of the room. Research papers and journals on
                theoretical physics, alchemy and philosophy lay scattered on the ground. The man had
                similar features to the boy I met earlier. He was handsome, to say the least. The woman was
                equally gorgeous. Her black hair was tied into a bun and she wore large, rounded glasses to
                match her gray sports apparel.
                <br><br>
                “Of all four fundamental forces of nature, I can’t believe gravity is the weakest! I mean a
                celestial body’s gravity can literally extend forever into space!” the woman said while
                throwing her hands in the air.
                <br><br>
                “Ruby, gravity is essentially a curvature in the space time continuum. According to Newton,
                anything with mass has gravity. In a nutshell, we are pulling at each other with our body
                mass” the man replied with a warm smile.
                <br><br>
                “Are you calling me fat, Desmond?” Ruby replied with a playful tone.
                <br><br>
                “Absolutely not! You’re so special in this universe that you don’t need mass to attract me.”
                <br><br>
                “Mmhmm ...I like where this is going.”
                <br><br>
                “You have a special position in my universe and…….”
                <br><br>
                “And?”
                <br><br>
                “I love you Ruby Hearthstone, my sunshine,” Desmond replied flirtatiously.
                <br><br>
                Ruby and Desmond smiled and fixed their eyes on each other. There was silence between
                them for a moment. Then, the smile melted from Desmond’s face.
                <br><br>
                “Every single night, I find it hard to sleep knowing that one day someone or something will
                try to break us apart. Ruby, I want us to be together. When that day comes, promise me you
                won’t let go of me. I’ll do the same for you. Promise me, please? I’m scared of letting you go”
                said Desmond.
                <br><br>
                The scene shifted to a cemetery. Tombstones lined up in ordered horizontal and vertical
                rows. The smell of incense filled the air, dragging along with it a dreaded sense of loss and
                sorrow. A middle-aged man stood in front of an ordinary tombstone. He was wearing a
                black coat and baggy slacks. Although his face was scarred and wrinkled, his identity was
                unmistakable-Desmond. Beside him was a young man in military uniform with polished
                badges.
                <br><br>
                “Don’t do this, Joshua,” Desmond told the soldier.
                <br><br>
                “I have to, father. If I didn’t volunteer, these men and women would have died in vain. Mom
                would have died in vain! This war destroyed our homes, killed our loved ones.” said Joshua
                while pointing at the tombstone beside him and his father.
                <br><br>
                “Please, I beg you not to go. It has already pains me to see your mother lying in the dirt. I
                don’t want to visit my son here one day,” said Desmond.
                <br><br>
                Then, there was absolute darkness and silence. I was lying down in a shack I built.
                <br><br>
                I picked up a photograph on the ground. It was a photo of Desmond, Ruby and Joshua, one
                happy family--my family. I placed the photograph on my desk and found a death
                notification from the War Office. My son was killed in action. I held back a tear. Then, I
                remembered the words of the boy from my dream. It finally made sense to me now. I
                walked out to embrace the sunshine and uttered those words under my breath: <br><br>
                “All that is will eventually be lost, entropy must take its course. Let go and be happier, old
                man. </p>
